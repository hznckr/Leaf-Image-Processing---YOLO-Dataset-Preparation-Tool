# Leaf Image Processing & YOLO Dataset Preparation Tool
Leaf image processing and YOLO dataset preparation with an intuitive GUI.

---

## Description
A PyQt5-based desktop application for leaf image processing, applying filters, segmentation, and generating YOLO annotation files.  
This tool simplifies dataset preparation for YOLO models by offering batch filtering, automatic labeling, and a user-friendly GUI.

---

## Features
- Apply multiple image filters: HSV, Canny, K-Means, Threshold, Crop, Transparent Background
- Batch process images
- Automatic YOLO annotation generation
- Class selection based on folder structure
- User-friendly GUI

---

## Dataset
The Flavia dataset contains 1,907 leaf images from 32 plant species, each with 50â€“77 images.  
It is widely used for leaf classification tasks.

You can download the dataset from the official SourceForge page:  
[Download Flavia Leaf Dataset](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flavia/files/Leaf%20Image%20Dataset/1.0/Leaves.tar.bz2/download)

After downloading, extract the dataset and organize the images into folders by species.  
Each folder should be named according to the plant species (e.g., `Acer_Palmatum`, `Berberis_Anhweiensis`).  
This structure will facilitate the automatic class labeling feature of the tool.
